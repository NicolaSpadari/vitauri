## Technologies used

- Vite
- Vue 3
- UnoCSS
- Typescript + linting
- API auto import (you can add more or disable some in the `vite.config.ts` file) by `unplugin-auto-import`
- Components auto import by `unplugin-vue-components`
- Composables auto import
- File system based routing by `vite-plugin-pages`
- Useful set of composable APIs by `@vueuse/core`

## Setup

  Before running this app, you need to configure your environment. Take a look at the [tauri docs](https://tauri.studio/docs/getting-started/prerequisites/)

  ```bash
  # use this template
  npx degit NicolaSpadari/vitauri my-tauri-app

  # go into the folder
  cd my-tauri-app

  # install dependencies
  npm i

  # start the project
  npm run dev
  ```

  This will fire up two shells, one for Vite and one for Tauri, simultaneously. Your project will run in a new window when ready.

  To build the application:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  To build the application with devtools enabled for debug:

  ```bash
  npm run build:debug
  ```

## Debugging
You can simply open the console as you would normally in the browser during development.
<br>
You need to compile the app in debug mode to test it when you want to debug your builded project.

## Notes

I built this simple demo wrapping the `shell` api and the `notification` api in a composable.
<br>
If you don't need this, you can just remove it and call the functions directly, for example if you need to handle the output in a more specific way.
I'm also auto importing some of the APIs through `unplugin-auto-import`, if this creates confusion feel free to remove them and import them manually.
